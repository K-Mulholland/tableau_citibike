Tableau Citibike

Using a CitiBike bike rental dataset, I identified trends between member riders and casual riders to create interactive visualizations and provide insight into future business ideas (building potential future bike stations, adding more electric bike options, conducting surveys to identify reasons behind trends, etc).



How many CitiBike users are casual vs members?
Which kind of bike do casual and member riders use the most?

What are the usage trends at the most popular start and end stations?
